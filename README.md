# NOTICE
This has been refactored to use the GitHub API, the standalone script is located in the `new` branch. Soon this repo will be tidied
---
This was a gist I started using quite a bit and I though packaging it would make it easier

## Installation
```
pip install github_subdir_dl
```

## Usage
```
github_subdir_dl <github_subdir_url>
```
It will not download binary files.

Might get timeout by GitHub (wip)
